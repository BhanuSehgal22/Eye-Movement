MIT xPro Eye Exercise

MIT xPro eye movement assignment is an interactive animation that creates two eyes that follow your mouse cursor around the browser by utilizing CSS and javascript.

Move your cursor around inside the browser window to see the eyes move.



This styled animation could be updated by adding more eyes, changing the eye color or allowing the eyes to go crosseyed when the mouse cursor passes in between them for future development.
